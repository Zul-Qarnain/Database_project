Here are the SQL queries based on the schema you provided. Each operation follows the requirements you specified: **simple query, single-row function, group/aggregate function, subqueries, joins, and views.**

---

### 1. **Simple Query**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Price > 500;
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves books with a price greater than 500.

---

### 2. **Query with a Single Row Function**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT Title, UPPER(Author) AS Uppercase_Author FROM Books;
```

**Explanation:** Converts the author names to uppercase.

---

### 3. **Query with a Group/Aggregate Function**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT AdminID, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity 
FROM Books 
GROUP BY AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Calculates the total quantity of books managed by each admin.

---

### 4. **Single-Row Subqueries**
**Query 1:**
```sql
SELECT Title 
FROM Books 
WHERE Price = (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Books);
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves the title of the book with the highest price.

**Query 2:**
```sql
SELECT Title 
FROM Books 
WHERE Quantity = (SELECT MIN(Quantity) FROM Books);
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves the title of the book with the least quantity.

---

### 5. **Multiple-Row Subqueries**
**Query 1:**
```sql
SELECT Title 
FROM Books 
WHERE Price IN (SELECT Price FROM Books WHERE Price > 500);
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves titles of books priced above 500.

**Query 2:**
```sql
SELECT Title, Quantity 
FROM Books 
WHERE AdminID IN (SELECT AdminID FROM Admin WHERE AdminID < 5);
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves titles and quantities of books managed by admins with an ID less than 5.

---

### 6. **Four Types of Joins**

#### a. **Inner Join**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT B.Title, A.aEmail 
FROM Books B 
INNER JOIN Admin A ON B.AdminID = A.AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves book titles along with the admin's email managing them.

---

#### b. **Left Join**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT A.AdminID, B.Title 
FROM Admin A 
LEFT JOIN Books B ON A.AdminID = B.AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves all admins and their respective books (if any).

---

#### c. **Right Join**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT A.AdminID, B.Title 
FROM Admin A 
RIGHT JOIN Books B ON A.AdminID = B.AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Retrieves all books and the corresponding admins (if any).

---

#### d. **Full Outer Join**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT A.AdminID, B.Title 
FROM Admin A 
FULL OUTER JOIN Books B ON A.AdminID = B.AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Combines all admins and books, including those that do not match.

---

### 7. **Simple View**
**Query:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AdminBooks AS 
SELECT A.AdminID, A.aEmail, B.Title, B.Quantity 
FROM Admin A 
INNER JOIN Books B ON A.AdminID = B.AdminID;
```

**Explanation:** Creates a view to display admin details and the books they manage.

---

### 8. **Complex View**
**Query:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AdminBookDetails AS 
SELECT A.AdminID, A.aEmail, B.Title, B.Price, BC.CategoryName 
FROM Admin A 
INNER JOIN Books B ON A.AdminID = B.AdminID 
INNER JOIN BookCategory BC ON B.ISBN = BC.ISBN 
WHERE B.Price > 500;
```

**Explanation:** Creates a view showing admin details, book details, and category information for books priced above 500.
